## 📝 Overview

EchoVid generates animated videos from text or audio prompts.  
This repository contains a **sample dataset** demonstrating the outputs generated by the pipeline.  

---

## 📂 Dataset Contents

`Sample Data/` folder includes:

- `text_prompts.txt` → Example text prompts used for generation  
- `audio_prompts/` → Example audio prompts used for generation  
- `Generated images/` → Sample frames extracted from videos (17 images)  
- `Generated videos/` → Short demo videos (12 videos)  
- `Echovid_Contributions.md` → Describes our contributions and enhancements to the pipeline

## 🗂️ Internal Dataset for Video Generation

`EchoVid-InternalData/` folder includes **data structures used internally** by the EchoVid pipeline:

- `human_words.json` → List of human/character-related keywords  
- `motion_words.json` → List of motion/action-related keywords  
- `scene_descriptions.json` → Mapping of scene types to scene descriptions  
- `prompt_rules.json` → Rules applied to refine and enhance prompts before generation  

> **Purpose:** These JSON files represent the “internal dataset” that guides how EchoVid interprets text/audio prompts, decides motion, adds characters, and refines scenes for smooth, consistent, and realistic videos.
